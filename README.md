### Projects
#### Criminals Arrest Classification(2018)
Performed comprehensive data analysis on incidents of crimes.\
Evaluated the performance of Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLP with metrics including Accuracy, Precision, True Positive Rate, True Negative Rate, Balance Error Rate, and Speed. \
Analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each machine learning model and discussed the reason why it failed/succeeded.\
Interpreted the model results and identified impactful data attributues. 
#### Fall Detection and Classification for People with Dementia(2019)
Designed a fall-detection hardware-machine learning methodology for the falling problem of people with dementia. \
Collected data with accelerometer and Arduino, classified the data with machine learning models and printed the decision message on a website with a WiFi shield.
#### Yelp Restaurant Photo Classification(2019)
Extracted features with PCA, HOG, and CNN including InceptionResNet152, VGG16, ResNet50, and ResNet152.
Performed multilabel classification with Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
Evaluated the results with Subset Accuracy, Mean F1 score, and Hamming Loss.
Discussed the deployment target markets for software companies and application users from three dimensions including motivation, benefit and cost.
#### Book Recommendation with Goodreads Interactions Histories(2020)
Converted the data to Parquet format and stored it in the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
Built and evaluated a recommender system with Apache Spark.
Visualized the high-dimensional item factor distribution in 2D with UMAP.
#### Yelp Fake Review Detection(2020)
Experimented with various oversampling and undersampling techniques. \
Built features from Count Vectorizer, TF-IDF Vectorizer, Word2Vec, Emotion Lexicon, and User Behavior Patterns. \
Compared the performance of BERT and traditional machine learning models including XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM. \
Constructed an optimal hybrid model combining the best models on different types of features. 
#### Autonomous Driving Detection System(2020)
Optimized Variational Autoencoder(VAE) and LSTM to build an Encoder-Decoder framework that detects top-down view roadmap and localizes nearby objects from six-view camera videos (with PyTorch, PyTorchLightning, Distributed Training, VAE, Feature Pyramid Network(FPN), LSTM, Yolov3, ResNets, EfficientNet, Transfer Learning, K-means, CNN, Data Augmentation).
