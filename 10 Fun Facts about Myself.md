1. I passed the middle school entrance exam with a score slightly higher than the requirement, but I won the 17th place in my town in the high school entrance exam.  
2. Once, on a boating trip in the ocean with four friends, our boat caught fire. Fortunately, the boating company’s employees were able to put it out. However, they were reluctant to give us a refund. It took almost two hours’ worth of negotiating, but I was finally able to get our money back.
3. I was very self-motivated as a child. I frequently rewarded myself for tasks, for example with a piece of candy after I had completed my homework.
4. One of my favorite activities is people watching. I like to observe the behaviors of others and imagine their lives while at the airport, in restaurants or on subways.
5. I may frequently forget where I’ve placed my phone, but my ability to remember melodies and numbers is unmatched. For example, I can identify the singer and name of a song within ten seconds If I have listened to it multiple times. What’s more, If I bought something before, I can recall its price at the grocery store without hesitation. 
6. I am afraid of whales since a blue whale swam next to me in a VR game. I got terrified as it stared at me with an eye larger than my head.  
7. My favorite fictional character is Scarlett in Gone with the Wind because she always displays a strong spirit, optimism and determination in the face of challenges.
8. Whenever I feel stressed, cleaning my room can always bring me peace of mind. 
9. I love to plan trips for myself and my friends and family. I enjoy researching the best travel routes and booking tickets well in advance in order to eliminate any stress and anxiety during the vacation.  
10. I love ice creams and kombucha.
