## Description of experiment
### What hyper-parameters did you try for each model?  
Bias Model: damping \
BiasedMF Model: feature and reg
### How did you pick the range of values to test?
The damping parameter range is the integer 0-9 generated by np.arange(10). \
The reg range is 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10\
The feature range at first was small, i.e. feature<=50. I observed that in this case, the model performs best when feature=50 in all of 5 trials (Please refer to [link](https://github.com/NYU-Search-Discovery/lab-1-movie-ratings-Mollyyyyy/blob/master/out) for the result). Therefore, I increase the upperbound of feature to be 330. The final range for feature is 10,  90, 170, 250, 330 (Please refer to [link](https://github.com/NYU-Search-Discovery/lab-1-movie-ratings-Mollyyyyy/blob/master/out2) for the result).
### How many users, items, and ratings were used (on average) by your train, validation, and test splits?
On average, I got\
Train: 610 users, 8834 items, 77447 ratings\
Validation: 610 users, 5043 items, 19356 ratings\
Test: 122 users, 2188 items, 4033 ratings
## Results
I compared the validation rmse on all of the candidate values of hyperparameters, then calculate the test rmse on the best setting, i.e. hyperparameters with the lowest validation rmse. Finally, I calculate the mean and standard deviation of the test rmse across 5 trials for Bias and BiasedMF respectively.
### Here is the result for above procedure.
