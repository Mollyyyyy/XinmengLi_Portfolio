My codes are on the notebook and it use python 3
*** [ Tabulate ]***

The one *optional* dependency I have in this code is `tabulate` ([documentation](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabulate)), which you can install using a simple `pip install tabulate`.
This package is quite useful for generating the results table in LaTeX directly from your python code, which is a practice I encourage all of you to incorporate into your research as well.
If you do not install this package, the code does not write out the results to file (there's no runtime error).
